## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Follow the steps below to get started with Tailwind CSS in this project lazismu.
### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is installed with Node.js by default.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd project-directory
```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here's how to use Tailwind CSS in your project:

1. Include Tailwind CSS in your HTML file or import it into your CSS file:

``` html
<!-- Link to the compiled Tailwind CSS file -->
<link href="path/to/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
1. Start customizing your project's styles by using Tailwind utility classes. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for the list of available classes and their usage.

2. To compile and generate the production-ready CSS file, run the following command:

``` bash
npm run build
```

The compiled CSS file will be available in the dist/ directory.

1. Link the compiled CSS file to your HTML file:
``` html
<link href="path/to/dist/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

1. Start your development server and view your project in the browser:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Customization <a name="customization"></a>

You can customize Tailwind CSS by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](htttps://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for more information on customization options.

Replace `project-directory`, `path/to/tailwind.css`, and other placeholders with the appropriate values based on your project's structure.

Remember to customize the instructions and information in the README according to the specific details of your project. Provide clear steps for users to set up Tailwind CSS in their environment and include any additional information they might need to know.

Also, don't forget to include a license file (LICENSE) and adhere to the terms of the chosen license for your project.


<!-- Installation composer on project -->
## Composer

To include Composer in your project, you need to create a `composer.json` file in the root directory of your project. This file will define the dependencies and configuration for your project. Additionally, you'll need to install Composer on your system.

Follow these steps to add Composer to your project:

1. Install Composer:

    If you haven't installed Composer on your system, you can download and install it using the following command:

    ```bash
    # Linux / macOS
    sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

    # Windows (Run as Administrator in Command Prompt)
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

    ```

2. Create `composer.json`
In your project's root directory, create a new file named `composer.json`. Inside this file, define your project's dependencies and any other relevant configuration.

    For example:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "your-project-name",
        "description": "Brief description of your project.",
        "require": {
            "some/library": "^1.0",
            "another/library": "2.*"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Replace `"your-project-name"`, `"Brief description of your project."`, and the sample dependencies with the actual name and description of your project and the required dependencies for your project.

3. Install Dependecies

    Once you have defined the `composer.json file`, run the following command in your project's root directory to install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

    This command will read the `composer.json` file and install the required dependencies into a `vendor` directory in your project.

4. Autoloading

    Composer can also handle autoloading for your project. To enable autoloading, add the following to your composer.json:
    ```json
    {
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
            "YourNamespace\\": "src/"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `"YourNamespace\\"` with the appropriate namespace for your project and `"src/"` with the directory containing your project's PHP classes.

5. Include Autoloader in PHP files

    In your PHP files, you can include the Composer-generated autoloader to automatically load your classes.

    For example, if your classes are under the `src` directory and you defined the autoloading as shown above, add the following line at the top of your PHP files:

    ```php
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    ```

    With Composer installed and the `composer.json` file set up, you can easily manage dependencies and autoload classes in your project. Remember to commit the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to version control so others can install the dependencies easily using `composer install`.
